                    <h1>About Coldplay</h1>
                    <p>Coldplay, are an English alternative rock band, formed in London in 1996-1997. Chris Martin, who
                        became the lead singer and frontman of the band, and Jonny Buckland, who became lead guitarist,
                        were
                        looking forward to form a band while at University College London. After forming Pectoralz, Guy
                        Berryman joined the group as a bassist and they changed their name to Starfish. Will Champion
                        joined
                        as a drummer and backup vocalist who plays various instruments, making the band's lineup
                        complete.
                        Phil Harvey was the group's manager between 1998 and 2001, and has been described as the band's
                        fifth member. The band finally changed their name to "Coldplay" in 1998. Tim Rice-Oxley was to
                        be
                        added to the lineup, but he refused as he was working with Keane. The band later recorded and
                        released three EPs; Safety in 1998, Brothers & Sisters as a single in 1999 and The Blue Room in
                        the
                        same year. The latter was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.</p>

                    <p>Coldplay's early material was compared to acts such as Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, U2, and Travis.
                        They
                        had worldwide fame with the release of the single "Yellow" in 2000, followed by their debut
                        album
                        released in the same year, Parachutes, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's
                        second
                        album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), won multiple awards, including NME's Album of the
                        Year.
                        Their next release, X&Y, received a slightly less enthusiastic yet still generally positive
                        reception upon its release in 2005. The band's fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and
                        All
                        His Friends (2008), was produced by Brian Eno and released again to largely favourable reviews,
                        earning several Grammy nominations and wins. Coldplay have sold over 50 million records
                        worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <p> Since the release of Parachutes, Coldplay have drawn influence from other sources, including
                        Echo &
                        the Bunnymen, Kate Bush, George Harrison and Muse on A Rush of Blood to the Head, Johnny Cash
                        and
                        Kraftwerk for X&Y and Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine on Viva la Vida. Coldplay have
                        been
                        an active supporter of various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's Make Trade Fair
                        campaign
                        and Amnesty International. The group have also performed at various charity projects, such as
                        Band
                        Aid 20, Live 8, Sound Relief, Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief, and
                        the
                        Teenage Cancer Trust.
