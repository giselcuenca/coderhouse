                <h1>About Coldplay</h1>
                <p class="band__p"> "Coldplay, British rock pop group whose melodic piano-driven anthems lifted it to
                    the top of the pop music world in the early 21st century."</p>
                <p>Coldplay was formed in 1998, London, with the pairing of pianist-vocalist
                    Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland. Whose first met during their orientation week at
                    University College in September 1996. The pair spent the rest of the college year planning a band,
                    ultimately
                    forming a group called <b>Pectoralz.</b>The band was later filled out with fellow students
                    Guy Berryman on bass and Will Champion, a guitarist who later switched to drums.</p>
                <p> By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves <b>Starfish</b>, performed gigs for local Camden
                    promoters at small clubs. Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, to be
                    the band's manager and the unofficial fifth member of the group. <br></p>
                <p> The band's lineup was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties, he quickly
                    learned the drums, despite having no previous experience. The band finally settled on the
                    name <strong>"COLDPLAY"</strong> which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been
                    using the name for
                    his group</p>

        <article class="band container">

                <h3>MUSIC EVOLUTION</h3>
                <p>Coldplay penetrated the U.K. Top 100 in 1999 with the single
                    “Brothers & Sisters” on the independent Fierce Panda label before signing with major label
                    Parlaphone.
                    Later that year the band released the Blue Room EP to a flurry of glowing reviews.</p>
                <p>Coldplay's full-length debut "Parachutes" (2000), sold millions on the strength of Martin's vocals
                    and such singles as the bittersweet “Yellow.” Parachutes earned the band its first Grammy Award,
                    for best alternative album, and paved the way for the more ambitious "A Rush of Blood to the Head"
                    (2002). The latter album earned the group two more Grammy Awards, and singles such as “Clocks”
                    helped drive the band's total album sales over the 20 million mark.<br></p>
                <p>Coldplay followed the concert album Live 2003 (2003) with "X & Y" (2005), a collection of
                    guitar-driven,
                    arena-friendly rock anthems (like the hit “Speed of Sound”) that elevated the group to the rank of
                    such “big bands” as U2 and Radiohead.The band's 2008 release, Viva la Vida, topped the charts in
                    the USA and the UK, and the album's title track was the number one single on both sides of the
                    Atlantic.</p>
                <p class="band__p">That popularity was reflected at the 2009 in the Grammy Awards, where the band
                    won "song of the year, best rock album,
                    and best pop performance by a group".</p>
                <p> Coldplay returned with the sleek Mylo Xyloto (2011), featuring a duet with pop singer Rihanna.
                    Later releases
                    included the subdued Ghost Stories (2014), which yielded the hit singles “Magic” and “A
                    Sky Full of Stars”; the upbeat A Head Full of Dreams (2015); and the EP Kaleidoscope (2017). To
                    mark the release of Everyday Life (2019), Coldplay performed two live-streamed concerts, one at
                    sunrise and the other at sunset, in Amman, Jordan. It was the band's eighth album to reach the
                    top spot on charts.</p>

                <h3>ACTIVISM</h3>
                <p>During the early years, Coldplay became widely known in the media for giving 10 percent of the band's
                    profits to charity, which they continue to do. Guy Berryman said, <b>"You can
                        make people aware of issues. It isn't very much effort for us at all, but if it can help people,
                        then we want to do it."</b> The band also asks that any gifts intended for them are donated to
                    charity.</p>
                <p>
                    In June 2009, Coldplay began supporting Meat Free Monday, a food campaign started by Paul
                    McCartney
                    which attempts to help slow climate change by having at least one meat free day a week.From
                    17-31 December 2009, Coldplay auctioned a quantity of significant band memorabilia, including
                    their first guitars. Proceeds went to Kids Company, a charity which helps vulnerable children
                    and young people in London.Currently, Coldplay keep being involves in charity.</p>
                <p class="band__p">"If you were to ask me, after all that we've been through. Still believe in
                    magic? Yes I do, of course I do" - Magic</p>
